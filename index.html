                <p>
                    An employment specialist with complementary expertise at the complex interface of employment and commercial contractual dispute resolution, Alexander MacMillan is one of the most active employment barristers on the circuit. Clients come to Alex, in part, because of his all-round capability in the employment arena, as well as the measured, thorough and reassuring way in which he works. Alex also maintains a particularly lively advisory practice and is, quite increasingly, sought out on some of the most esoteric and complicated points of employment law.

                    Comfortable in the appellate courts, and with several recent appearances before the EAT, High Court, and Court of Appeal, Alexâ€™s robust and precise style of advocacy leaves no stone unturned, whilst also leading to practical and pragmatic results. Alex shines in matters requiring a deep analytical assessment of the prevailing issues and laws, and has the rare ability to boil down the most complex of issues into plain and easy-to-digest poin
