                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>
                    An employment specialist with complementary expertise at the complex interface of employment and commercial contractual dispute resolution, Alexander MacMillan is one of the most active employment barristers on the circuit. Clients come to Alex, in part, because of his all-round capability in the employment arena, as well as the measured, thorough and reassuring way in which he works. Alex also maintains a particularly lively advisory practice and is, quite increasingly, sought out on some of the most esoteric and complicated points of employment law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comfortable in the appellate courts, and with several recent appearances before the EAT, High Court, and Court of Appeal, Alex’s robust and precise style of advocacy leaves no stone unturned, whilst also leading to practical and pragmatic results. Alex shines in matters requiring a deep analytical assessment of the prevailing issues and laws, and has the rare ability to boil down the most complex of issues into plain and easy-to-digest points, as well as provide his clients with viable, feasible and pragmatic options in the context of a litigation or dispute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from a thriving employment and wider commercial practice, Alex also has a personal interest in law practised across different jurisdictions, and the intersection of law and where different legal systems conflict. To that extent, he has a growing cross-border practice, which Alex’s global clients or UK-based clients with international operations particularly value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex brings a wealth of wider understanding and experience from a distinguished background in international relations and also in humanitarian work. Prior to becoming a barrister, Alex worked for the Permanent Delegation of Japan to the OECD. A keen advocate against discrimination, Alex also worked as an advocacy advisor for the AIDS Law Unit of the Legal Assistance Centre in Windhoek, Namibia, visited a Syrian refugee camp in northern Greece, and liaised with a legal NGO in Bangalore (India) working on building understanding between the judiciary and sex workers vulnerable to exploitation.

                <h2>News & Articles</h2>
                <div class="article-item">
                    <h3>The justice system’s debts</h3>
                    <p>You don’t have to pore through the pages of the Ministry of Justice’s statistics publications to be struck by the stark imbalance between the tally of employment cases that are filed each year, and the tribunal service’s ability to hear them. But if you do take a moment to review the statisticians’ report, it tells of a growing backlog, snowballing as though it were a cumulative debt being run up against the justice system’s tab.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Litigation risk and ‘administrative risk’</h4>
                    <p>That debt will need to be settled at some point, if the system is to retain its credibility. There comes a point at which, if a complainant knows that getting a hearing will take many years, it ceases to be desirable to pursue a claim at all. Parties always have to deal with the vicissitudes of trial — ‘litigation risk’. But the risk we are talking about is of a different character — essentially there is now ‘administrative risk’, being the risk of not being heard within a satisfactory timeframe due to underfunding of the tribunal system. At that point of despair, while the laws on employment rights continue to exist on paper, they cease being relevant because unenforced.</p>
                    <p>Instead of looking at the figures about the annual shortfall in serving justice, you could also simply talk with a sample of litigants about their experiences, as I commonly need to do in my role. Litigants commonly have the unfortunate experience of having to wait a year — or more commonly several years — to have their cases heard, and tribunal correspondence often suffers from the same lag-time caused by the imbalance between case load and resourcing. Tribunal cases that have taken a year of more to come to trial can be put off at the last minute, sometimes for a whole year or more, due to a lack of judicial resources. Anecdotally, I have experienced this situation more than once in recent months.</p>

                    <h4>Three solutions</h4>
                    <p>We can now see why the current situation developed. What other solutions — beyond the current steps around the use of video technology and promoting or mandating judicial mediation and conciliation — can we identify? I have three suggestions which I may return to later:</p>
                    <ol class="solutions-list">
                        <li>The most obvious solution is political: reverse the MoJ funding cuts to eliminate the structural justice deficit. But any such 25% MoJ funding surge would require UK voters considering justice a service worth spending money on.</li>
                        <li>Tool-up Acas. I have previously written about Acas’s services being plainly under-funded. Most tribunal claims settle, or are withdrawn, or get struck out. Many of the remaining 10% make it to a full hearing at which both parties would be better served by quality conciliation services.</li>
                        <li>This one is more controversial: Commercial B2B contracts often mandate arbitration to avoid the cost and delay of court proceedings. Put simply, per s203 ERA 1996, in the UK employment agreements cannot provide for the employee ‘contracting out’ of their rights to bring a claim to enforce their legal rights. But if the employment tribunal system will not be made ready perhaps a shadow employment arbitration service should be allowed to serve the growing need for speedy remedy.</li>
