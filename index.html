                    <h2>Profile</h2>
                    <p>An employment specialist with complementary expertise at the complex interface of employment and commercial contractual dispute resolution, Alexander MacMillan is one of the most active employment barristers on the circuit. Clients come to Alex, in part, because of his all-round capability in the employment arena, as well as the measured, thorough and reassuring way in which he works. Alex also maintains a particularly lively advisory practice and is, quite increasingly, sought out on some of the most esoteric and complicated points of employment law.</p>
                    <p>Comfortable in the appellate courts, and with several recent appearances before the EAT, High Court, and Court of Appeal, Alex's robust and precise style of advocacy leaves no stone unturned, whilst also leading to practical and pragmatic results. Alex shines in matters requiring a deep analytical assessment of the prevailing issues and laws, and has the rare ability to boil down the most complex of issues into plain and easy-to-digest points, as well as provide his clients with viable, feasible and pragmatic options in the context of a litigation or dispute.</p>
                    <p>Aside from a thriving employment and wider commercial practice, Alex also has a personal interest in law practised across different jurisdictions, and the intersection of law and where different legal systems conflict. To that extent, he has a growing cross-border practice, which Alex's global clients or UK-based clients with international operations particularly value. Alex brings a wealth of wider understanding and experience from a distinguished background in international relations and also in humanitarian work.</p>

                        <h3>No "personal reasons" defence in TUPE automatically unfair dismissals</h3>
                        <p>This article addresses the implications of the Court of Appeal's decision in <em>Hare Wines Ltd v Kaur & Anor [2019] EWCA Civ 216</em>, a case in which I acted for the successful Claimant at first instance, in the EAT, and in the Court of Appeal. The judgment clarifies the application of the 'sole or principal reason' test under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE).</p>
                        <p>A key takeaway from the judgment is the rejection of the argument that a dismissal can be insulated from the automatic unfair dismissal provisions of TUPE simply because the dismissing manager was not personally motivated by the transfer itself. In <em>Hare Wines</em>, the dismissing manager claimed to have dismissed the employee for personal reasons, yet the dismissal occurred in the context of a TUPE transfer where her role was redundant post-transfer. The Court of Appeal upheld the Tribunal's finding that the transfer was the principal reason for the dismissal, rendering it automatically unfair.</p>
                        <p>The case serves as a critical guide for employers. It underscores that tribunals will look beyond the stated, subjective reasons of an individual decision-maker to assess the objective context and causation. If a dismissal is connected to a transfer in anything more than a trivial way, and there is no separate, permissible 'economic, technical or organisational' (ETO) reason entailing changes in the workforce, it is likely to be found automatically unfair. Employers must therefore ensure that any dismissals proximate to a transfer are robustly and demonstrably for a reason unrelated to the transfer or fall squarely within the narrow ETO defence.</p>

                    <h2>News & Articles</h2>
                    <div class="article-item">
                        <h3>The Prosecutor’s Fallacy</h3>
                        <p>This is the classic illustration: a murder takes place. The forensics team identify hair from the crime scene. A DNA test is carried out, indicating that someone with a previous conviction who lives in the same town is a match.</p>
                        <p>The suspect is arrested. An expert report is produced: it states that there is only a 1 in 10,000 chance that the DNA of the former convict and the hair sample will be a positive match. Naturally the Crown Court’s jury is persuaded: here is a scientific expert, stating that there is only a one-in-10,000 chance that the accused is not responsible for the DNA trace.</p>
                        <p>But of course, after a moment’s reflection, we ought to realise that, if the DNA database were to contain tens of thousands of entries, that would be expected to lead not to one but perhaps to a number of other potential matches. Should we ignore those innocent matches?</p>
                        <h4>Algebraic expression of the fallacy</h4>
                        <p>The prosecutor’s fallacy is when the probability of innocence, given the evidence, is wrongly conflated with the very tiny probability that the evidence would occur if the defendant were innocent. In terms of probabilistic formula, it is wrongly assuming that the probability of:</p>
                        <p><code>P(Innocence | Evidence)</code> [the probability of the accused being innocent given he matches the DNA]</p>
                        <p>is no different to</p>
                        <p><code>P(Evidence | Innocence)</code> [the probability of an innocent person having a DNA match)</p>
                        <p>So: coming back to the example set out above, the probabilistic fallacy occurs if the jury confuse the (apparently) really tiny chance that there should be a DNA match if the accused were innocent, with the probability that the accused is in fact innocent in the light of the evidence.</p>
                        <p>They are not the same thing at all, although unfortunately this distinction does not jump out at us when verbally formulated: regrettably the two grammatical structures sound more like rephrased versions of each other. Instead, the confusing situation is best represented graphically, in the tree diagram as follows:</p>
                        <blockquote>Source: Norman Fenton and Martin Neil: ‘Avoiding Probabilistic Reasoning Fallacies in Legal Practice Using Bayesian Networks, presentation at 7th International Conference on Forensic Inference and Statistics (ICFIS) Lausanne, 21 August 2008</blockquote>
                        <p>In the example, only one of the 10,000 potential suspects can be the actual source of the DNA (i. e. the guilty person actually present at the scene and leaving a trace). However, because there is a 1/1,000 probability of there being a positive match among the larger 10,000-strong population of potential suspects, this means that about 10 (i.e. 10,000/1,000) innocent suspects would be a positive match.</p>
                        <h4>The Bayesian party trick</h4>
                        <p>The shocking, literally unbelievable conclusion we are forced to assent to, applying Bayes’ Theorem, is that you have to incorporate the objective statistical information and integrate it with the knowledge of the accused testing positive in order to interpret that properly.</p>
                        <p>The probability of the accused’s innocence, conditional on a positive DNA match, is not 1/10,000 (as would appear if you only considered the top ‘branch’ of the tree diagram above and as ‘common sense’ points to) but instead that there is a 10/11 (i.e. 90.1%) probability that the accused is innocent, based on the DNA match: in other words, out of the suspect population, around 10 would be expect to be DNA matches, so the accused, being a match, simply has a roughly 1/10 chance of guilt before we consider other evidence. Not guilty.</p>
                        <p>In finance the prosecutor’s fallacy is referred to as the base rate fallacy — the tendency in judgment to give preeminence to information specific to an individual and neglect the broader statistical context. It is, it would seem, a common problem in our habits of probabilistic reasoning across domains.</p>
                        <h4>Bayes in the employment law context?</h4>
                        <p>The use of Bayesian reasoning has been deprecated by the UK’s senior criminal courts for reasons Professor Fenton takes exception to. As an employment practitioner my concern is that our failure to apply rigorous probabilistic reasoning results in numerous errors of judgment, in circumstances where the nature of the judge’s decision-making process remains unexamined.</p>

                    <h2>News & Articles</h2>
                    <div class="article-item">
                        <h3>What do percentage figures mean when stating a legal case’s prospects?</h3>
                        <p>More than once, having drafted legal advice and distilled my opinion on prospects of success into a percentage figure, the client has come back to me and questioned how I arrived at it.</p>
                        <p>The simple answer is (or in my case was) that a percentage figure is desirable since language can be ambiguous. I read with interest the CIA’s online Intelligence Community Directive 203 on Analytic Standards: paragraph 6(2)(a) of that Directive sets out difficulties arising from purely verbal advice, even seeking to align particular phrases with percentage figures. ‘Analytic products’ have particular wording mandated: “unlikely” must be used for a level of confidence in the 20–45% range, and so on. The Directive is at pains to discourage careless use of language. A percentage figure does the same job as a verbal expression of belief, but with less room for misunderstanding than words cause.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the fact that a number is apparently unambiguous should not be taken to imply that the underlying opinion enjoys any privileged status akin to mathematical certainty. Rather, a percentage is an alternative or a complementary way of expressing strength of belief. The number still simply expresses a subjective probability. That, at least, is what I replied when a client asked me to disclose my calculations for arriving at a percentage figure. In general terms, I was correct. But in hindsight I realized this answer was also inadequate to the question posed.</p>
                        <h4>Beyond reasonable prospects</h4>
                        <p>In my own experience, the niceties of probabilistic thinking and statistical analysis did not get covered in Bar School. In the real world, a common legal convention is that the client (and always an insurer client making a funding decision) needs to know if a legal case enjoys ‘reasonable prospects’, which — in percentage terms — is interpreted as being 51% or above. In other words: is it a green light or a red light from Counsel? The latter ‘red light’ scenario provides a high-value off-ramp for the insurer.</p>
                        <p>The highly simplified form of question makes the task of the advisor more straightforward — there is no need to go into subtle reasoning about why one alights on a particular percentage figure, beyond rehearsing what law is engaged, and stating whether the case is more likely to win or lose. Does the client engage forwards gear or reverse?</p>
                        <p>Maybe that approach to legal advice works sufficiently well in the aggregate, for the insurer’s purposes. But clients investing their own money and reputation should rightly demand much more detail: ideally the opinion of any subject matter expert should be more informative than tossing a coin (see, for example, Gardner, D. and Tetlock, P.E.’s Superforecasting: the Art and Science of Prediction Random House, 2015 where special emphasis is placed on the value-added of precision in any percentage figure when making a forecast).</p>
                        <p>If legal advice is that prospects hover around 50%, the advisor benefits from being right or nearly right irrespective of the outcome, and the client is left frustrated. What value, in fact, did expensive legal advice add? As the CIA director James Clapper notes in his Directive:</p>
                        <blockquote>"Analytic products should indicate and explain the basis for uncertainties associated with major analytic judgments […] analytic products should express judgments that would be useful to customers, and should not avoid difficult judgments in order to minimize the risk of being wrong […] Analytic judgments should express judgments as clearly and precisely as possible, reducing ambiguity by addressing the likelihood, timing, and nature of the outcome or development"</blockquote>
                        <p>If proper legal analysis makes greater precision possible, it seems to me that the advisor should be brave and say so, even at the risk of being very wrong (should the gods see things differently from the specialist).</p>
                        <h4>Beyond point estimates</h4>
                        <p>Expressing prospects as a single number has the advantage of simplicity, but it is also uninformative. A single ‘point estimate’ can be represented as a dot on a 0–100 number line. That scale tells us about strength of belief in the answer to a specific legal question. Unfortunately, the point estimate tells us nothing about the assessor’s confidence in that particular number.</p>
                        <p>For example, it is obvious that there is a world of difference between 60% prospects in a range of 55–65%, on the one hand, and 60% prospects with a range of 35–85%, on the other. The latter, wider range indicates much more uncertainty about the 60%. In that sense, situating a point estimate inside a range of values is more informative — it adds a valuable dimension to the advice. I appreciate some advisors routinely do this; it helps.</p>
                        <h4>Visual legal advice</h4>
                        <p>We can go a lot further than simply providing a range of values. Risk professionals insist on the value of probability distributions to quantify uncertainty. This is because reference to a range of values still fails to tell us enough about how much expert belief is distributed around values that lie outside of the quoted range. And a simple range is also still silent as to the confidence around a particular point within that range (the distribution of belief within the range).</p>
                        <h4>Conditional probabilities</h4>
                        <p>If we are serious about the clear communication of legal advice, this approach also calls for more thought about how we reason about prospects of success in circumstances where the parameter of interest (in this case that percentage prospects figure) is usually conditioned on events which — in turn — impact the expert’s final assessment.</p>
                        <p>A better alternative exists: “Bayesian updating” is a statistical approach for arriving at an opinion showing the extent to which beliefs change to take account of the new data.</p>
                        <h4>Beyond ‘black box’ forecasting</h4>
                        <p>In practical terms, this means that — approached as a Bayesian estimation problem — a legal advisor can produce advice that quantifies uncertainty for the client, identifies the significant inputs into that estimation, and in doing so provides an audit trail indicating how a given opinion was arrived at.</p>
                        <p>Better (more precise) estimates also add value for the client and the justice system because, of course, fractional prospects of success are the multiplier required to assess a case’s expected value. If we can think clearly about how we approach this element of evaluation it will assist in promoting settlement at efficient levels, and avoiding unnecessary litigation.</p>

                    <div class="article-item">
                        <h3>On Forced Distribution Performance Management</h3>
                        <p>In 2019 the UK’s civil service changed its mind about its use of forced distributions, deciding instead to move to more flexible, non-mandatory objective setting. The change came about only recently, from April 2021, for the 2021–22 performance year. But it is a big change: the civil service has half a million employees.</p>
                        <p>The details of the former scheme are instructive — it worked as follows: civil servants’ performance was ranked from top to bottom, and a distribution overlaid as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the top 25% of Senior Civil Servants were ranked as <em>top performing</em>;</li>
                            <li>the 65% of civil servants deemed as coming below top performers were graded as '<em>achieving</em>'; then</li>
                            <li>the bottom 10% were '<em>low performers</em>'.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Where do these numbers come from? It is not entirely clear. If the system assumes a Gaussian (normal) distribution of performance, then one would expect it to apply the Empirical Rule. The central 65% looks like a rounded version of 1 standard deviation from the mean. Of course the ordering of the civil service bands does not follow the standard deviation form — in consequence the thresholds applied appear to be rather arbitrary.</p>
                        <p>The civil service is by no means the only large employer using this system. Microsoft used it, and the forced distribution system was recently the subject of staff complaints at KPMG — KPMG Chairman Bill Michael told employees to <em>stop moaning</em> about the system. They did not stop; he had to step aside.</p>
                        <p>The appeal of the system is that it forces managers to have awkward conversations with under-performers, and also provides a quantifiable way for workers to judge their own performance relative to their cohort.</p>
                        <p>So why would the UK civil service change course? For one thing, the approach measures <em>relative</em> performance — but arguably the proper test of interest to management is <em>absolute</em> performance. If you are a civil servant in a particularly talented team, your own impeccable work could land you in the low performers band in circumstances where of course you are not in fact underperforming.</p>
                        <p>A further problem comes with the ranking exercise — it is plainly a difficult matter to rank employees by performance, because to do so is to compare apples with pears. The difficulties entailed by redundancy selection processes are replicated at each stage of regular performance review.</p>
                        <p>And then there is the issue with employees gaming the system: strong performers have an incentive not to work together (hardly desirable). And, worse, there is an incentive to sabotage your team mates’ work for your own relative advantage.</p>
                        <p>Writing in the <em>Financial Times</em>, Sarah O’Conner further points out that research indicates the act of line managers giving feedback has also been shown to hurt performance in a third of all cases. (Footnote 1). The effect on morale is toxic — because necessarily just under half the population of workers are being told that their work is sub-par.</p>
                        <p>And another point: in terms of absolute performance — who says the normal distribution should apply anyway? For example, what if performance is influenced by a team’s positive group dynamics so that the actual performance distribution is right-skewed?</p>
                        <p>The latter seems likely, and has an analogy with the performance of the stock market: you might expect the performance of stock-market assets, in aggregate, to be always normally-distributed. In fact, due to reinforcing loops, stocks commonly move up and down together. That idea is a simple but powerful one and a rebuttal to those seeking to classify performance using relative measures as a proxy for absolute measures of value.</p>

                    <div class="article-item">
                        <h3>How to guess your award (without paying lawyers) — the employment law casino</h3>
                        <p>Imagine that, for whatever reason, you do not wish to engage a lawyer. Perhaps they are too expensive; perhaps lawyers do not have your trust. But you are numerate, and approach the endeavour with the seriousness of a bookie.</p>
                        <p>The context is you believe you have a strong employment claim (whether the claim is yours or simply one that your organisation anticipates paying for). Now, while normally people would reach into their pockets and commission an expert assessment from a specialist employment barrister, you say you did not wish to do so — how else might you know the right level of award to settle the claim and avoid tribunal?</p>
                        <h4>Making inferences from statistics</h4>
                        <p>One obvious way would be to look at the published statistics for levels of award for your type of claim. You would also want to look at the statistics over a number of years (to average out any outliers from unusual years). Then you would consider not only the average award, but above all the distribution of awards so that you could with some confidence estimate the likely range of values the award might take.</p>
                        <h4>But.. statistics are not available in an immediately useful format</h4>
                        <p>The truth is you would need to dig around quite a bit in order to get any meaningful data on this. There are repositories of tribunal statistics (see Footnote 1), published each quarter — but despite being publicly available, they are not at all designed for public consumption — there is no convenient way to obtain, for example, lists of the amounts of each award (Footnote 2) which are a basic prerequisite for constructing a distribution (Footnote 3).</p>
                        <p>Solicitors’ firms regularly use their websites to publish updates listing the average awards for each type of claim and the upper thresholds — because those summary statistics are published by the Ministry of Justice. But there is a limit to the usefulness of knowing the outlier award, and to the unfamiliar it is actually quite a misleading figure to headline with. Nor is the mean award a good measure, since it is a moment that is unduly influenced by outlier amounts.</p>
                        <h4>Claimants will hate this skewness</h4>
                        <p>Coming back to modelling the likely bounds of any award, one can see that in 2020 90% of the unfair dismissal awards fall below the value of £30k. The data is highly skewed (that is, highly asymmetrical). It is asymmetric with the skew to the left of the centre point — in other words, skewed in a way claimants will hate.</p>
                        <h4>Employers will hate this kurtosis</h4>
                        <p>The data also has a high positive score for kurtosis. Kurtosis tells us where the risk exists. Low (or negative) kurtosis means most observations fall within a predictable range, with little tail risk. High kurtosis, by contrast, indicates the presence of extreme surprises in the tails of the distribution. Our data has very high kurtosis. So: not good for those responding to claims. In terms of fitting the data to a known type of distribution, the unfair dismissal data appears quite close to a gamma distribution.</p>
                        <h4>Conclusions: hope for the best; prepare for the worst</h4>
                        <p>From this cursory analysis, one can clearly see why there is appetite to pay into insurance schemes covering employment claims: while most claims for unfair dismissal resolve for a relatively low sum of money, there is significant tail risk that should make any HR professional think twice before declining conciliation — we are not dealing with a normal distribution but one that is characterised by skewness, kurtosis, and a fat tail.</p>
                        <p>Of course, if one did engage a lawyer, these non-specific insights can be used in conjunction with expert advice on the particular facts of your case to determine the most likely outcome with more precision than a general statistical approach can afford.</p>

                        <p><small>Footnote 2: However, there are indications of the numbers of awards falling within pre-defined bands. It is an odd way of presenting data to the public, but is enough to use bootstrapping to generate useful statistics — which is the technique I had to use to generate the density histogram.</small></p>
