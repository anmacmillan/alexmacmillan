                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>
                    An employment specialist with complementary expertise at the complex interface of employment and commercial contractual dispute resolution, Alexander MacMillan is one of the most active employment barristers on the circuit. Clients come to Alex, in part, because of his all-round capability in the employment arena, as well as the measured, thorough and reassuring way in which he works. Alex also maintains a particularly lively advisory practice and is, quite increasingly, sought out on some of the most esoteric and complicated points of employment law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comfortable in the appellate courts, and with several recent appearances before the EAT, High Court, and Court of Appeal, Alex’s robust and precise style of advocacy leaves no stone unturned, whilst also leading to practical and pragmatic results. Alex shines in matters requiring a deep analytical assessment of the prevailing issues and laws, and has the rare ability to boil down the most complex of issues into plain and easy-to-digest points, as well as provide his clients with viable, feasible and pragmatic options in the context of a litigation or dispute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from a thriving employment and wider commercial practice, Alex also has a personal interest in law practised across different jurisdictions, and the intersection of law and where different legal systems conflict. To that extent, he has a growing cross-border practice, which Alex’s global clients or UK-based clients with international operations particularly value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex brings a wealth of wider understanding and experience from a distinguished background in international relations and also in humanitarian work. Prior to becoming a barrister, Alex worked for the Permanent Delegation of Japan to the OECD. A keen advocate against discrimination, Alex also worked as an advocacy advisor for the AIDS Law Unit of the Legal Assistance Centre in Windhoek, Namibia, visited a Syrian refugee camp in northern Greece, and liaised with a legal NGO in Bangalore (India) working on building understanding between the judiciary and sex workers vulnerable to exploitation.
